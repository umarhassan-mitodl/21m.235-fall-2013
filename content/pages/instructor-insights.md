## Instructor Interview

_Below Professor Teresa Neff describes various aspects of how she taught_ 21M.235 Monteverdi to Mozart: 1600-1800.

The assignments for 21M.235 are designed to give students the opportunity to study a specific work in more depth.

_Listening Guides_

{{< quote "With my comments and suggestions, I hope to encourage my students to explore the topic further . . ." "—Teresa Neff" >}}

Students are required to create a listenting guide on a work from the assigned listening and give a short presentation to the class. The goal of the assignment is twofold: to reinforce analytical listening skills and to practice describing a musical work. I give a sample listening guide at the beginning of the semester. While guides are to include some historical background on the composer and work, the primary purpose of the assignment is to engage with the compostion in more depth through formal, thematic, and harmonic analysis. The written guide demonstrates this analysis and includes timings from the assigned recording. After the presentation, students are encouraged to ask questions about both the piece and analysis. 

_Analytical Essay Project_

The largest written assignment for 21M.235 is the analytical essay. This assignment requires two drafts of the paper be submitted, which allows students to edit and revise their work. In addition to the written paper, students present their work to each other at the end of the semester. The topic (piece) is chosen by the student. I often meet wtih the student during this process; this provides an opportunity to discuss sources and approaches. I also encourage students to meet with me at any point on the project. The most productive meetings are often after I have returned the first draft of the paper. In the first draft comments, I suggest other avenues of research or approaches to the piece. With my comments and suggestions, I hope to encourage my students to explore the topic further, or, at a later time, pursue ideas beyond the scope of the final project for this class.
